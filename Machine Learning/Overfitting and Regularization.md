## 1. Problem of Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying pattern in the training data but also the noise. As a result, the model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data (test data).

### Signs of Overfitting

1. **High Accuracy on Training Data** but **Poor Accuracy on Test Data**.
2. **Complex Model** with too many parameters compared to the number of training examples.
3. **High Variance**: The model is sensitive to small changes in the training data.

### Causes of Overfitting

1. **Excessive Model Complexity**: Using a very high-degree polynomial or too many features.
2. **Insufficient Training Data**: The model might memorize the data instead of generalizing patterns.
3. **Lack of Regularization**: When the model is not penalized for large weights, it may overfit.

## 2. Cost Function with Regularization

Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function for large coefficients. This discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely.

### Regularized Cost Function for Linear Regression

For linear regression, the regularized cost function becomes:
$$
J_{\text{reg}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2
$$

Where:
- $h_\theta(x^{(i)}) = \theta^T x^{(i)}$ is the prediction.
- $\lambda$: Regularization parameter (controls the strength of the regularization).
- The first term is the regular cost function, and the second term is the regularization term.

### Regularization Term

- **L2 Regularization** (Ridge Regression): Adds the squared magnitude of the weights as the penalty term.
- **L1 Regularization** (Lasso Regression): Adds the absolute values of the weights as the penalty term.

## 3. Regularized Linear Regression

Regularized linear regression adds a penalty to the linear regression cost function to prevent overfitting.

### Regularized Linear Regression Cost Function:
$$
J_{\text{reg}}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( \theta^T x^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ controls the amount of regularization.
- The term $\sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2$ ensures that the coefficients are penalized, making the model less likely to overfit.

### Steps to Apply Regularization

1. **Initialize parameters**: Start with random values or zeros for $\theta$.
2. **Choose a regularization parameter**: A higher $\lambda$ means stronger regularization (i.e., more penalty).
3. **Apply the regularized cost function**: Use the modified cost function to compute gradients and update $\theta$.
4. **Gradient Descent Update**:
   $$ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) x_j^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_j \right) $$

## 4. Regularized Logistic Regression

Just like in linear regression, regularization can be applied to logistic regression to prevent overfitting.

### Regularized Cost Function for Logistic Regression:
$$
J_{\text{reg}}(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2
$$

Where:
- $h_\theta(x^{(i)}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x^{(i)}}}$ is the sigmoid function.
- The second term is the regularization term, which penalizes large values of $\theta$ to reduce overfitting.

### Gradient Descent Update for Regularized Logistic Regression:

For logistic regression, the gradient descent update rule with regularization is:
$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right) x_j^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_j \right)
$$

Note that for $\theta_0$ (the intercept term), we typically do **not** apply regularization, so the update rule for $\theta_0$ is:
$$
\theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)
$$

## 5. Choosing the Regularization Parameter $\lambda$

The choice of $\lambda$ is crucial in determining how much regularization is applied. A small $\lambda$ means little regularization, while a large $\lambda$ means stronger regularization.

### Techniques to Choose $\lambda$:

1. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Use cross-validation to select the best $\lambda$ by evaluating the performance of the model on a validation set.

2. **Grid Search**:
   - Try different values of $\lambda$ (e.g., $10^{-4}$, $10^{-3}$, $10^{-2}$) and choose the one with the best performance.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the training and validation error against $\lambda$ to find the value where the model achieves the best trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.

### Effects of Regularization:

- **Too large $\lambda$**: The model becomes too simple (underfitting).
- **Too small $\lambda$**: The model is more likely to overfit.

## 6. Summary of Regularization Techniques

- **Regularization** helps control the complexity of a model by penalizing large weights.
- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**: Penalizes large coefficients using the squared magnitude of $\theta$.
- **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Penalizes large coefficients using the absolute magnitude of $\theta$.
- **Logistic Regression** can also benefit from regularization, especially in high-dimensional data.
