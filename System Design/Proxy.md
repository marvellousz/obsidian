A proxy is an *intermediary server* between a client and another server. Proxies help with security, caching, traffic control, and anonymity.

Two types: *Forward* & *Reverse*

## Forward 

- Sits between a client and the internet 
- Can be used for privacy & anonymity, content filtering, bypass geo-restrictions, caching

## Reverse

- Sits between users and the backend servers
- Uses are load balancing, security & DDoS protection, SSL termination, caching & compression
