The high level structure of a software system, defining components, their relationships, and the way they interact.

## Common Architectural Styles

- Monolithic
- Layered (N-tier)
- Client - Server
- Microservices
- Event - Driven

## Monolithic Architecture

A single unified system where all components are tightly coupled and work as a single unit.
### Pros

- Simple to develop and deploy
- Easier to manage in smaller apps
### Cons

- Hard to scale
- Difficult to maintain as the codebase grows
- High risk of failure: A single bug can take down the entire system
### Use Cases

- Small scale apps
- Startups
- Simple CRUD-based apps
## Layered Architecture

A system split into multiple layers.
### Pros

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to scale and maintain compared to monolithic
### Cons

- Performance overhead due to layers
- May result in tight coupling between certain layers
### Use Cases

- Enterprise Apps
- CRM systems
- Banking Apps
## Microservices Architecture

A system built as a collection of small, independent services, each focused on a specific business capability

### Pros

- Independent services can be scaled, deployed and developed separately
- Flexibility in technology stack for each service
- Better fault tolerance
### Cons

- Increased complexity in communication and coordination
- Need for robust DevOps and automation pipelines
### Use Cases

- Large scale apps
- e-commerce platforms
- Modern cloud-based platforms
## Event Driven Architecture

A system where components communicate through events instead of direct calls enabling loose coupling.
### Pros

- Highly decoupled architecture
- Excellent for handling async workflows
- Better scalability for high traffic systems
### Cons

- Debugging and tracing become more complex
- Difficult to ensure data consistency across services
### Use Cases

- Real-time systems
- IOT apps
- Financial Trading Platforms
## Factors influencing Architecture Selection

- Business Needs
- Scalability
- Performance
- Maintainability
