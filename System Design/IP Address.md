These are unique numerical labels assigned to devices on a network.

There are *two* versions: 
1. IPv4
2. IPv6

### IPv4

- Most widely used protocol version
- 32-bit address format
- Total addresses: 4.3 billion
- Limited IP addresses only
- There are security concerns

### IPv6

- 128-bit address format
- Addresses: 340 undecillion, literally unlimited
- Larger address space, better security, and improved routing efficiency

#### So, why do we need private ips?

- Conserves public IP addresses
- Enhances security
- Enables NAT to allow multiple devices to share a single public IP
- Common in corporate networks, data centers, and cloud environments

## Role of IPs

- Scalability
- Security
- Load Balancing
- Cloud Networking
- Microservices & Containers
