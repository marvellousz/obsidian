It is a high-performance, binary protocol optimized for microservices & real-time communication

- It is built on HTTP/2, allowing
	- Multiplexed requests (multiple calls over one connection)
	- Compression (smaller payload sizes)
	- Full-duplex streaming (real-time bidirectional communication)
- Uses protocol buffers (ProtoBuf) for fast serialization (smaller & faster than JSON)
## Use Cases

- Microservices
- Real-time streaming
- IOT & Low Bandwidth apps
- Multi-language ecosystems
