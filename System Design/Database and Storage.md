### Structured and Unstructured Data

- Structured: Rows/Columns, predefined schema
- Unstructured: No schema, flexible format
### Categories of Storage

- Database storage (SQL/NoSQL)
- Object storage (eg: S3)
- File storage (eg: NFS)
- Block storage (eg: EBS)
### Storage Props

- Durability - Data persists even after failures
- Availability - Data can be accessed when needed
- Consistency - Every read returns the most recent write
- Atomicity - Operations are all-or-nothing (relevant in transactional storage)
### The Trade-offs in Storage Design

*Scalability VS Reliability VS Performance*
- No perfect solution - must trade off between
	- Scale
	- Reliability 
	- Performance
